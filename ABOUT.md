arduino bluetooth remote apk and code

Here we use HC -05 bluetooth module for the communication between the arduino and android app.
Whenever you press up button in the app it sends the signal as 1 to the arduino so the program goes into that case.
Similarly 2 for down,3 for left,4 for right ,and 5 for stop.
You can use this app for your conveniences  also by changing the code according to your convenience . You can use this code for home automation also by using relays.
The default password for connecting the Bluetooth is 1234 .Sometimes 0000 as password in rare cases.
